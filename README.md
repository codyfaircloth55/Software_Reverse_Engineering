<h2>Software Reverse Engineering</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>This repository contains work from two projects for software reverse engineering.</p>
<h3>Project 1:</h3>
<p>In this project, a legacy binary file was provided for reverse engineering into a C++ file. This was accomplished by converting binary into assembly then creating a C++ file based on the assembly file and the observed functionality. Documentation regarding conversion and the created C++ file are in the Project1 folder.</p>
<h3>Project 2:</h3>
<p>In this project, the C++ file created in project 1 is analyzed for vulnerabilites. Vulnerabilities are identified and mitigation strategies are given in the vulnerabilites assessment documentation. Mitigations are implemented in the C++ file. The documentation and modified C++ file are in the Project2 folder.</p>
